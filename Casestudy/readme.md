# Description:
 The Wearable gadgets is a form of embedded system that take real time inputs from mode  of operations and from sensors .


# Requirement:

## High Level Requirement:


*	To display the time .
*	To track the different activities of the user like running, cycling, walking.
*	To display different sensor readings.

##	Low Level Requirement:

*	Vibration alert for notification.
*	LED Blinking while reading sensor readings.
=======
* To display the time .
* To track the different activities of the user like running, cycling, walking.
* To display different sensor readings.

## Low Level Requirement:
* Vibration alert for notification.
* LED Blinking while reading sensor readings.



# Component Description:

1)	SENSOR:
*	Humidity  & Temperature Sensor:
          Measure and report the moisture and air temperature of surrounding.
*	Accelerometer:
          Measure how movement changes over time means for tracking whether   we are cycling, running.
*	Blood Pressure sensor:
          Used  to measure blood pressure and heartbeat.

2)	 DISPLAY:
 * Display the input and output. There are 4 screen types used in Smart watch : OLED, E-link, Traditional LCD and sharp memory LCD. 
     
3)	Battery:
There are 2 types of battery , Lithium ion and lithium polymer
Smart watch need lithium polymer it need regular power charging.
    

4)	Vibration Motor:
It is needed for notification alert or any sensor reading alert.

## Projector

## SDRAM
* This is random access memory which is synchronised with clock speed for microcontroller is optimized.
* Helps to accept new data before the processing of previous data.

## HDMI PORT
* HDMI port is used ito transmit and receive both audio and video signals.

## Storge Interface
* USB port

## AUDIO OUTPUT
* Speaker

## Temperature Sensor
* Device overheating get detected .

## microcontroller
* Controll all input and output operations.
* Perform all operations.

## Backlight operations
* Helps in enhancing the video output.
